# Digital Nomad Gear Guide

Okay not **truly** nomad. Molly and I decided mid-pandemic to begin a year of
travel. Not to the extreme of #vanlife or quit our jobs, but to travel to a new
city in the United States every couple of weeks. Here's a guide on all the gear
we used to keep working effectively in a portable package.

## The Bags

- Brevite Jumper

## The Workhorse

- MacBook Pro
- AirPods Pro


## The Ergonomic Setup

- Roost Laptop Stand
- Apple Magic Keyboard
- Apple Magic Trackpad

## The Influencer Package

- Sony a6500
- Sony 18-105 f/4
- Sony 16 f/1.4
- DJI Mini 2
- GoPro Hero 8
