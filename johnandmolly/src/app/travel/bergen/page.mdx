# Bergen Norway

We kicked off our Scandanavian adventure in a city on the west coast of Norway
nicknamed **"The Heart of the Fjords."** A small town feel despite it being the
second largest city in Norway. We stayed at [a
hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hh8MtEDngcxtxQbs9) really close to the main port
in the heart of town so exploring was a breeze.

## Food

### [Mandalay Sushi & Burmese](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PQbSoVYZt7CM6LhA7)

Our first day was mostly a travel day to get here, but we ended up wandering
around the cobblestone alleys and popping into a bunch of different spots for
food and drinks. Mandalay was where we had a proper meal. The sashimi, spicy
tuna roll, and sake were all delicious and our waiter was super friendly.

REINDEER HOT DOGS!! After getting pretty toasty hopping from wine bar to
cocktail bar to pub, we hit up this street-side hot dog stand for a classic
reindeer dog. The thing was so scortching hot that we both burnt the roofs of
our mouths. The glizzy was good but it had a sort of bologna like texture that
made it feel weird.

## Nature

### [Fl√∏yen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J5c1FR11EnU59G5w9)

We hiked up the super cool forresty trail to the overlook and then took the
cable car down. There was some pretty low fog the morning we did this but it
made for a dramatic moody hike and we caught glimpses of the view as the clouds
rolled through.
