            answer="You may be asking yourself 'Why is this question even on here?' We have opted to not have a cake at our reception and apparently a lot of y'all are flabergasted at this decision. There will be dessert, but we don't want anything taking away from the dance party and frankly, we don't care too much about sweets. Just wanted to set the expectation ahead of time that no cake will be present. ðŸ˜‚"
